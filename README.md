How to run:
Open your git instance (I use git bash) & clone the project
  $ git clone git@github.com:randomTreees/O3.git

Once the project as successfully cloned, open the O3 folder

Once opened, the contents contain all files neccessary to view both exercises

To view exercise #1:
  Open 'index.html' in your browser of choice

To view exercise #2:
  Open 'index2.html' in any document processer/viewer


Notes:
Typically I would use the LESS preprocessor and have my classes nested in each other for better readablity & to avoid having styles applied to anything else outside the component. I also like to nest the media queries inside the class as well so the way the element is targeted is identical to the original class for any responsiveness.

I eyeballed spacing as best as possible & used PhotoShop for some color picking.

Normally when working in a code base, I would also use a branching strategy of having a develop branch and then branch off the develop branch for each exercise. However, I did not see the need for this strategy under these circumstances.
